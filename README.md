# Organic Compound Lipophilicity

### Main goal: 
Predict lipophilicity of compounds using GNN (Graph Neural Network)

### Dataset:
From ChEMBL database containing experimental results for logD (octanol-water distribution coefficient)

### Significance:
Lipophilicity is crucial in drug discovery as it influences ADME properties. Optimal lipophilicity alows drug to cross cell membranes, hence affecting it bioavailability and therapeutic answer.
